# object-detection-using-openCV-and-python
Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves locating and identifying objects within an image or video stream.
With the rise of deep learning and artificial intelligence, object detection has become more accurate and efficient than ever before. In this project, we will explore how to use OpenCV and Python to perform object detection using AI techniques.
The project began by introducing the basics of computer vision, including image processing and filtering techniques. I then moved on to deep learning concept of SSD (Single Shot Detection). I implemented the selected object detection framework using OpenCV, Python, and AI libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset I used to train the model was the COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context), which contains over 330,000 images and more than 2.5 million object instances.
Once the model was trained, its performance was evaluated on a set of test images and videos, measuring its accuracy and speed.
